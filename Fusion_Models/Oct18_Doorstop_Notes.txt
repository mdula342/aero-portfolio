# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Doorstop Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the Three Point Arc command and review and expand knowledge of the Chamfer, Emboss, and
Offset Faces commands.

**Design Summary:**
- Created sketch of side profile and extruded.
- Applied a Chamfer to the top face.
- Sketched the lateral skirt of the doorstop on one side and mirrored.
- Used the three point arc to create the top section of the skirt.
- Used the Shell command to hollow the doorstop wedge
- Embossed a single rubber ridge for grip and used the Rectangular Pattern command to create full pattern.
- Filleted ridges and other sharp edges.

**Notes:**
- Next step: Use Fusion to model the highest performing fin from OpenRocket simulations (Week 2 project)
