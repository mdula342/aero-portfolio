# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Ice Cube Tray Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Objective:** Practice applying a taper angle to an extrusion, using the rectangular pattern feature,
creating a midplane construction plane, and applying the shell command with respect to multiple faces

**Design Summary:**
# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Ice Cube Tray Model
- Created block of appropriate size
- Extruded the first ice cube cell and applied a taper angle of 10 deg
- Used the rectangular pattern feature to make a 7 by 2 collection of cells
- Used the shell feature to hollow the cube around the cells by selecting five faces
- Created the outer lip by sketching on a midplane construction plane
- Used the sweep feature to extend the lip all the way around and filleted all sharp edges

**Notes:**
- Learned that it is best to minimize sketch dimensions as much as possible in favor of constraints
- Missed a fillet edge early on and subsequently learned that the sweep command only works on smooth curves
(filleted the sharp edge and finished sweep) 
- Next step: Create and extrude a custom shape (Week 2 project)
