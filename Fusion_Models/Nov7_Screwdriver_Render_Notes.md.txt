# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Screwdriver Render 

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 7, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn Rendering using Appearances, an In-Canvas Render, Decal, and final Render

**Design Summary:**
- Used a simple extrusion to create a surface for the screwdriver to sit on
- Opened the Render workspace and added appearances to each component of the screwdriver as well as the 
  surface, editing the color of the screwdriver tip to represent its extra tempering 
- Used the In-Canvas Render feature to preview the appearance of the final product
- Used the Decal feature to add a decal to the handle of the screwdriver
- Used the Render feature to run a local render set to Final
  
**Notes:**
- Learned that it is possible to simply drag a new appearance over an older one in the appearances tab. 
  This replaces the old appearance with the new one in every instance, which saves considerable time in
  larger models
- Learned how to edit the Scene Settings to achieve the desired appearance
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
