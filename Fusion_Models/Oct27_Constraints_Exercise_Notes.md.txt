# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Constraints Exercise

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Objective:** Better understand the proper methods for constraining sketch geometry by using the 
	       twelve main sketch constraints

**Design Summary:**
- Horizontal/Vertical Constraint – Used to make the center vertical line stay perfectly upright and 
	to ensure the top two lines remain perfectly horizontal.
- Coincident Constraint – Applied where the vertical line meets the upper horizontal line, keeping their 
	endpoints joined so they always touch.
- Tangent Constraint – Added between the arc on the left and its two connecting lines to create smooth 
	tangent transitions at both sides of the rounded corner.
- Equal Constraint – Used on the two top horizontal lines so they stay the same length.
- Parallel Constraint – Applied between two non-horizontal angled lines on the right side so they remain 
	parallel.
- Perpendicular Constraint – Used at multiple corners, including where the leftmost vertical and top 
	horizontal lines meet, to maintain clean 90° angles.
- Fix/Unfix Constraint – Applied to the intersecting pair of lines on the far left and top left to fix
	all aspects of their geometry
- Midpoint Constraint – Used to snap the endpoint of the central vertical line to the midpoint of the 
	bottom horizontal line.
- Concentric Constraint – Applied between the small inner circle and the larger outer arc on the left to 
	ensure they share the same center point.
- Collinear Constraint – Used on the two top horizontal segments to align them along the same line, 
	merging their axes.
- Symmetry Constraint – Applied to the pair of isolated lines within the sketch geometry, using the 
	middle vertical line as the axis of symmetry.
- Curvature Constraint – Applied to the small separate sketch on the right between the straight line and 
	the spline to create a smooth, continuous (G2) curve transition.
