# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Light Bulb Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the Cylinder and Sphere commands, expand knowledge of the Intersect command and
Appearance feature

**Design Summary:**
- Used Cylinder command to create an appropriately dimensioned cylinder on the x-y origin plane
- Used Intersect command to create two construction lines running perpendicular and horizontal to the top
of the cylinder
- Used Sphere command to create a sphere centered at the end of the perpendicular construction line
- Filleted the intersection of the sphere and cylinder as well as the bottom edge of the cylinder
- Applied LED appearance to bulb as well as a glossy plastic appearance to the base
- Created additional cylinder on bottom to provide a body to thread
- Created thread and offset 3 mm, then Chamferred the remaining surface
- Added a final cylinder for the "electrical foot contact" and chamferred it
**Notes:**
- The cylinder that I created for the thread body had to be defined with a height of -15 mm instead of 15 mm 
because of the way that I initally set up my graph. This caused the thread to start from the bottom. The Offset 
feature in the Thread command only offsets from the relative bottom of the thread, meaning the top of my cylinder.
I solved this problem by creating two cylinders on top of each other, and only applying the thread to the larger one
that corresponded to the desired length of thread
- Next step: Use Fusion to model the highest performing fin from OpenRocket simulations (Week 2 project)
