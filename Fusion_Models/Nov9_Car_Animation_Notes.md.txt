# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Car Animation

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Objective:** Become familar with the Animation workspace through the Auto-Explode, Reverse, Restore Home
               and Transform commands, along with editing actions in the timeline

**Design Summary:**
- Used the Auto-Explode command to create an exploded view, making it sequential so as to simulate
  the assembly process in the timeline
- Right clicked on the storyboard and selected Reverse to reverse the sequence
- Experimented with dragging individual actions around in the timeline and redefining their durations
- Created a new storyboard, used the Transform command to detach every component from the car body, and 
  used the Restore Home command to generate assembly actions in the timeline
- Sequenced these actions in the desired order 
- Used Transform again to move the entire car out of the frame to simulate driving away

**Notes:**
- Learned that every action, including zooming in or out, is captured by the timeline if the playhead is
  not in the scratch zone
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
