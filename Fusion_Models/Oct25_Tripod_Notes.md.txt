# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Tripod Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn Axis Perpendicular to Face at Point command, and better understand the value of 
fully parametric modelling in duplicated components

**Design Summary:**
- Created new component under the root component for later copying
- Sketched an equilateral triangle and lofted to a point to make a pyramid 
- Used the Shell command to hollow the tripod, and extruded a circle from one side to save material
- Used the Axis Perpendicular to Face at Point command to draw an axis through the tripod, which allowed
the used of the Circular Pattern feature to replicate the extruded circle to each lateral face
- Copied the component and pasted twice: once using the Paste option and one using the Paste New option
- Edited the original tripod to observe that the changes also applied to the Paste copy, but not
to the Paste New copy
**Notes:**
- Observed the efficiency of projecting existing geometry to render fully parametric designs, which then
apply to every copy made
- Learned that sometimes the automatic Adjust option within the Circular Pattern feature sometimes renders
very skewed results and needs to be substituted
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
