# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Rocket Fin Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Objective:** Model the properly dimensioned fin from the highest performing OpenRocket simulation

**Design Summary:**
- Sketched lines based on the following dimensions (cm): root chord: 4, height: 3, tip chord: 2.5, sweep length: 1.73
- Sketched a perpendicular line from the start of the tip chord and applied a sketch dimension of 1.73 
between the start of the root chord at the origin and the intersection point of the perpendicular line
and the root chord. This ensured the proper dimensions. 
**Notes:**
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (week 3 project)
