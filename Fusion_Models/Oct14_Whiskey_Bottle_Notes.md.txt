# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Whiskey Bottle Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn to utilize the loft, intersect, mirror, and thread features and make offset planes

**Design Summary:**
- Sketched the profiles needed by the loft command using offset planes
- Used the intersect feature to apply a guide rail and mirrored it across the center axis of the bottle
- Used the loft command to create the 3d shape and made a bottle stem to recieve the thread
- Filleted remaining sharp edges, used the shell command to hollow the bottle, and added a thread to the stem

**Notes:**
- Learned that the shell feature does not work if curvature is too sharp
- Learned that sketch fillets are not ideal (because they undo certain constraints), but are sometimes necessary 
when using features such as the loft command
- Learned that the "Modeled" box must be checkmarked before finishing thread, otherwise it will not be applied
to the 3d printed or exported bottle
- Next step: Create and extrude a custom shape (Week 2 project)
