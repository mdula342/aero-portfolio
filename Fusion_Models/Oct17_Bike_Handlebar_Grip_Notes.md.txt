# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Bike Handlebar Grip Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the Text, Emboss, and Combine [3d bodies] features

**Design Summary:**
- Created a cylinder of appropriate size
- Used the Text feature to inscribe brand name
- Used the Emboss feature to convert the inscription to 3d
- Created the grip pattern using the Rectangular Pattern feature
- Hollowed the cylinder using the Shell feature 
- Used the Combine feature to combine the many bodies created by the grip pattern
- Created the final inner edge by offsetting and extruding

**Notes:**
- Learned that Shell doesn't work with embossed text given the sharp curvature (went back to
to the step just before the Emboss command and shelled the cylinder)
- Found that it is helpful to define extrusions that will be patterned in the future as individual bodies
- Next step: Use Fusion to model the highest performing fin from OpenRocket simulations
