# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Design Intent Exercise

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 26, 2025  
**Objective:** Better understand design intent in parametric modelling 

**Design Summary:**
- Created a center rectangle, placed a center circle inside, and extruded the remainder of the rectangle
to make a washer plate
- Learned how to apply a dimension so that the circle is always half the length of the edge,
by using the dimension number divided by 2, i.e., d1/2
- Made a Paste New copy of the plate and then learned how to make the circle always 40 mm from the bottom
edge. Deleted a coincident constraint at the center point, applied a 40 mm dimension betweeen the circle
center and the bottom edge, and applied a vertical constraint the the origin and center point

**Notes:**
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
