# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Chess Set Two Part Mold Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the the process of creating a two part mold with registration marks, and the 
               Split Body command

**Design Summary:**
- Created a rectangle around the pieces and extruded such that it enclosed each piece
- Activated the Combine command and cut the pieces from the block
- Used the Split Body command to split the box down the XZ origin plane
- Created polygons on the surface of the right body, extruded them, and used the combine command to
  cut them out of the left body to create the registration marks
- Used the Offset Face command to apply the necessary clearance within the registration mark holes
- Chamferred the outer edges of the mold for convenience
**Notes:**
- (The two halves of the mold are titled "Left" and "Right" under the "Mold Box" component, if you plan 
  on opening the file to see inside the mold)
- Learned that little cusps or edges are not ideal to have on the part line, as they can create 
  slightly messy results. Saw that the solution is simply to rotate the piece around its joint
  so that it is perfectly symmetric about the part line and has as few intricate details lying on the
  part line as possible
- Used a slightly different CAD file than the tutorial for the chess pieces that were being molded,
  and after the Combine command I was left with screws that had been in the bottom of the pieces. I
  applied a separate Combine command to cut them out of the mold
- Learned the techniques for cutting pour holes in more complex molds, as well as the importance of
  vent holes (to avoid air bubbles and poorly rendered details) in such molds.
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
