# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Toy Block (from Oct.11) Drawing

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 8, 2025  
**Objective:** Become familiar with the Drawing Workspace by creating and editing different views through
               the Projected View, Detailed View, Dimension, and Radius Dimension commands

**Design Summary:**
- Navigated to File > New Drawing > From Design
- Placed the base (a side profile) and used Projected View to add the other side profile and both the
  the bottom and top views; also added a 3D isometric view in the top right corner
- Altered every view by double clicking on the base view and selecting "Visible Edges."
- Converted the alternate side profile to "Hidden" and the 3D view to "Shaded"
- Clicked and dragged views to achieve desired spacing
- Practiced adding dimensions using the Dimension tool, as well as fillet dimensions using the
  Radial Dimension command
- Used the Detailed View command to present the fillet dimensions, as they were quite small
  

**Notes:**
- Learned that the taskbar on the bottom of the workspace allows for convient drawing additions
- Learned that any necessary annotations can be created using the Text feature
- Learned how to use the Automatic option in place of Manual
- Learned quite a bit about the preference settings and how my graphics drivers can limit Fusion 360's 
  performance, as many of my computer's graphics features required updates
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
