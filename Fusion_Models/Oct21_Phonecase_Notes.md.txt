# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Phonecase Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn how to import external designs and use the Joint command, as well as reiterate 
use of the Project and Sweep commands

**Design Summary:**
- Imported a CAD file of a Google Pixel
- Used Joint to lay it flat on an origin plane
- Used the Sweep feature to create a basic case around it
- Offset the edge of the Sweep from the screen and chamferred it
- Projected geometry that required any cutouts and then used the "To Object" option in Extrude
to cut away the case to the inner face

**Notes:**
- Learned that you can connect points by using a Three Point Arc and then assigning a Conincident constraint
to the third point and a point far away, which essentially deletes the arc and connects the endpoints
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
