# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Parameters Exercise

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn how to use parameters and the Joint command

**Design Summary:**
- Began by opening Change Parameters from the Modify menu to define User Parameters that controlled 
  design dimensions through reusable equations.  
- Created parameters named BoxWidth and BoxHeight, assigning them values of 50 mm and 40 mm; noted that 
  parameter names could not include spaces.  
- Drew a two-point rectangle on the bottom origin plane of a new “Box Bottom” component, applying the 
  BoxWidth parameter to both dimensions and renaming the sketch for clarity.  
- Extruded the rectangle using BoxHeight / 2 to create the bottom half, then used the Shell command to 
  hollow it while defining an "on-the-fly" parameter WallThickness = 2 mm.  
- Verified that parameters created during operations appeared in the Favorites list and tested their 
  functionality by changing expressions—confirming the model updated automatically.  
- Practiced parametric design discipline by fully constraining the sketch and testing parameter changes 
  to ensure relationships behaved as expected.  
- Duplicated the bottom component to create a “Box Top” using Right-click > Copy > Paste New so it could 
  be modified independently of the original.  
- Applied the Joint tool to align and position the top relative to the bottom, defining joint origins at 
  opposing corners and adjusting rotation to achieve correct lid orientation.  
- Confirmed that modifying any User Parameter automatically resized both components and maintained the 
  joint relationship, completing the creation of a fully parametric box.
