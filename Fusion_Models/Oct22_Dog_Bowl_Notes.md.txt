# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Dog Bowl Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn basic surface modelling (Revolve, Thicken, and Offset commands), the Trim command and 
Section Analysis 

**Design Summary:**
- Sketched an outline of the right hand side profile of the bowl using the Line command
- Applied the Trim command to remove excess line length used as a buffer during the sketch
- Applied the surface modelling Revolve command to create full shape and applied a fillet to sharp edges
- Used the Thicken command to convert the surface into a solid body
- Used the Offset command to create another body around the flange of the bowl for a rubber grip
- Used Section Analysis to observe the thickness of the bowl from a cutaway perspective
**Notes:**
- Learned that surface bodies have one gray face and one yellow face which helps distinguish them
from solid bodies
- Learned that surface modelling is much better for creating complex geometries efficiently 
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
