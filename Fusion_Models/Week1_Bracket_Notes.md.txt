# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Bracket Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Objective:** Practice sketching, constraints, and extrusion.

**Design Summary:**
# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Cube Model
- Sketched the basic shape and assigned constraints and dimensions.
- Rounded the edges and extruded the sketch into a body, then created a new sketch on one of the surfaces of the body.
- Used the construction lines of the new sketch to help create a series of circles which I then extruded to make holes in the bracket.

**Notes:**
- Learned the functions of many more types of constraints 
- Next step: Create and extrude a custom shape (Week 2 project)
