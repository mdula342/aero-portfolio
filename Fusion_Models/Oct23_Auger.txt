# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Auger Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 23, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn Pipe, Coil, Project to Surface, and Plane Along Path commands

**Design Summary:**
- Used the Pipe command to create a thin pipe on the x-z plane
- Used the Coil command to wrap the outline of the auger spiral around the pipe
- Used to Project To Surface command to project the body of the coil onto the surface of the pipe
- Used the Plane Along Path command to create a plane at the bottom of the coil and created a rectangle
of the length and width of the auger blade
- Used Sweep command with a guide surface to create the full auger spiral
- Created an offset plane below the pipe to sketch a point, and then lofted the pipe to the point
to create a sharp spike
- Chamferred start of blade

**Notes:**
- Learned that the Sweep command sometimes requires a guide surface to avoid problematic geometry
intersections
- Learned that seemingly harmless geometry can disrupt the loft command, and that often this problem can
be solved by projecting one or more of the loft profiles
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
