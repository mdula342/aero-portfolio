# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Hinge Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the Combine command and how to create a basic hinge

**Design Summary:**
- Positioned the two halves of the box made the day before side by side
- Sketched out the basic side profile of the hinge
- Extruded the sketch and placed another extruded center circle on it to form the nub of the hinge
- Made another adjacent sketch connecting to the other box half, and extruded it
  making sure to add an offset between the two halves of the hinge for clearance
- Used the Combine command to cut out the nub out of the second extrusion to allow freedom of motion
  and added an offset within the cutout for the same reason
- Mirrored the hinge over to the other side 
**Notes:**
- Noted the use of an extrusion angle, which was applied to the nub
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
