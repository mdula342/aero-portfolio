# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Propeller Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 4, 2025  
**Objective:** Progress in surface modeling capability by learning the Loft command and key surface 
               surface modeling concepts

**Design Summary:**
- Inserted a canvas of a triple bladed propeller 
- Sketched a center circle for the central hub
- Created an offset plane near the intersection of the blade with the hub and sketched a three point
  arc to outline the base of the blade
- Created a second offset plane far out from the blades and drew a long line such that, when the endpoints
  were connected to the endpoints of the three point arc on the hub, the connecting lines contained the 
  full profile of the blade
- Used the surface Loft command to create a surface body connecting the three point arc and the long line
- Used a Fit Point Spline to sketch the overhead shape of the blade on the XY origin plane
- Extruded the edge of the sketch to the top of the hub
- Used the Trim command to cut away the part of lofted body outside of the extruded blade profile,
  leaving the body corresponding to the inclusive intersection of the loft and extrude
- Used the Circular Pattern feature to duplicate the body around the hub three times
- Used the Thicken command to create solid bodies from the three surface bodies

**Notes:**
- Learned key surface modeling vocabulary, including "surface", "edge", and "boundary"
- Learned use of Patch tool
- Saw an excellent example of how combinations of multiple, simple sketches can create a more complex shape
- Learned that surface modeling commands very often require less sketch geometry 
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
