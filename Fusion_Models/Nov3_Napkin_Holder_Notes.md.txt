# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Napkin Holder Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 3, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the basic rules of sheet metal modelling with different usages of the Flange 
               command and the Sheet Metal Rules selection; learn the Full Round Fillet option and 
               to create flat patterns

**Design Summary:**
- Sketched a center rectangle and then opened the sheet metal tab
- Activated the Flange command and selected the rectangle
- Reactivated the Flange command and selected the two long edges, and created the two walls of the 
  napkin holder
- Used the Full Round Fillet option from the Fillet command to round over each side
- Used the Offset command to create a slot outline in one of the sides by offsetting the edges of the side 
- Extruded this outline by selecting To Object and clicking on the far face of the opposite side to 
  create the full slots in both sides
- Sketched a very small circle on the base and cut it from the body
- Changed the sheet metal rule to a particular type of steel well suited to a napkin holder

**Notes:**
- Learned how to select outer and inner options within the Flange tool for both Height Datum and 
  Bend Position and what differences they make, which are particularly important for high precision 
  modelling
- Learned that fabrication companies need the small hole in order to hange the product for powder-coating
- Observed the methods for exporting the file for manufacturing
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
