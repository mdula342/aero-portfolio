# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Hex Nut Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn the Circumscribed Polygon tool, Custom Chamfer feature, and Hole command

**Design Summary:**
- Circumscribed a hexagon and extruded
- Applied the Custom Chamfer tool to top half of nut
- Used the Hole command
- Created a Midplane Construction plane and mirrored the chamfer using the "Faces" option

**Notes:**
- Upon completion, found that thread overlapped the chamfer
- Learned that the solution is to change the "Thread Offset" option to "Offset" and apply the correct
dimension, in this case, 8.5 mm.
- Next step: Create and extrude a custom shape (Week 2 project)
