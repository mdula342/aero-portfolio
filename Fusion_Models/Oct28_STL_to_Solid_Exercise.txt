# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: STL to Solid Exercise

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Objective:** Better understand the uses of Convert Mesh, Face Groups, and the different options
	       of those commands

**Design Summary:**
– Began by importing an STL mesh file through Insert > Insert Mesh, selecting the file from the 
  computer, and taking note of the scale since STL files are unitless.
– Opened the Mesh tab and ran Convert Mesh after ensuring there were no repair warnings; this 
  tool allowed the translation from mesh triangles to solid geometry.
– Used the Faceted conversion first, which quickly produced a solid but retained thousands of 
  small triangular faces, suitable for measurement or planar edits only.
- Switched to the Prismatic method, which rebuilt clean faces for a more editable solid; this 
  required generating Face Groups to define boundaries between surfaces.
– Tested both Fast and Accurate face group options — Fast worked well for simple parts, while 
  Accurate was necessary when small miscolored regions or misidentified edges caused surface-only results.
– Re-converted the mesh after refining the face groups, resulting in a proper solid body that 
  could be extruded, thickened, or embossed, though it remained non-parametric.

**Notes:**
– Learned that a gold mesh icon will appear in the side panel to distinguish meshes from 
  other geometry
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
