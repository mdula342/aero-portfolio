# Week 3 - Fusion 360 Basics: Rocket1 Nosecone Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 1, 2025  
**Objective:** Independently produce an accurately dimensioned model of the nosecone of rocket project #1,
	       kit #1948

**Design Summary:**
- Created an ellipse of major axis length 127 mm and minor axis length 41.6 mm 
  (used the given specifications)
- Used the Cut tool to trim all but one quarter of the ellipse
- Revolved this quarter around the Z axis to create a semi-ellipsoid
- Used the Shell command to hollow the cone at the given wall thickness of 3.18 mm
- Projected the circle of the inner base onto a sketch on the XY origin plane, and extruded it to make
  a shoulder for the cone to sit in the body tube of the rocket
- Used the hole command to hollow this cylinder with the same wall thickness as before
**Notes:**
- Learned that it is best to consider the dimensions of projects carefully before starting. Needed to
  redo the cone several times after misinterpreting the base diamter measurement as the distance between 
  the two inner edges of the cone
- The fins will be modelled as soon as they can be measured upon the arrival of the physical kit
