# Week 1 - Fusion 360 Basics: Paperclip Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Objective:** Practice using the tangent arc and sweep features

**Design Summary:**
- Sketched the necessary lines in the proportional parallel orientation
- Used a tangent arc to achieve the correct curvature at the paperclip ends
- Used the sweep feature to create the final 3d figure

**Notes:**
- Learned organizational skills regarding sketch nomenclature, i.e., naming each individual sketch is a best practice
- Learned keyboard shortcut for center circle
- Learned that sweep features can be used in capacities other than strictly 3d solid shapes
- Next step: Create and extrude a custom shape (Week 2 project)
