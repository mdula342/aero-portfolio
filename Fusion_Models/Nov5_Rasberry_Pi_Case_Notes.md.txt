# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Rasberry Pi Case Edit

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 5, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn Mesh commands such as Create Mesh Section Set, Fit Curves to Mesh Section, 
               Tessellate, and Combine, as well as multi-directional extrusions

**Design Summary:**
- Imported an STL file of the Rasberry Pi Case
- Used the measuring tool to create an offset plane of the same hight as the case
- Used Create Mesh Selection Set to facilitate the desired editing
- Used Fit Curves to Mesh Section to allow the change of the size of four vertical holes in the case
  and created additional circles that overlapped the previous ones to ensure that the design was without 
  gaps
- Extruded these circles using two directions so that the extrusion lined up perfectly with the height of
  the case
- Used the Tessellate tool to convert the extrusions to mesh bodies
- Used the Combine tool to combine them with the original body
- Used another offset plane to create text on the top of the case, and extruded again
- Used Tessellate and Combine to cut the text out of the top of the case
**Notes:**
- Learned that the measuring tool can be defined based on many different coordinate systems, which allows
  convient use
- Learned how to choose the proper refinement when using the Tessellate feature
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
