# Week 4 - Fusion 360 Basics: Simple (Vase 1) and Complex (Vase 2) Vase Models

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** November 6, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn to use Form modeling through the following Create Form commands: Edit Form, Revolve, 
               Circular Symmetry, Insert Edge, Crease, Split Body, and Patch

**Design Summary:**
- Vase 1: used a Create Form menue to create a cylinder
- Applied the Edit Form command to expand the width of two rows near the bottom to create the desired 
  curvature
- Extended the top of the vase to balance the proportions
- Vase 2: Sketched a side profile of the vase using a spline sketch
- Used the Revolve command in the Create Form tab to produce a vase shaped Form
- Changed the number of faces by defining twenty longitudinal lines and eight lateral lines
- Turned on Circular Symmetry so all changes would propogate to every edge
- Added a new set of vertical edges by using Insert Edge to offset an edge by ten percent of the width 
  between it and the adjacent edge
- Selected all edges and used the Crease command to turn all edges into sharp connections
- Used the Edit Form command to drag the edge lines outwards to create sharp ridges
- Removed the symmetry parameter and applied the Edit Form command to rotate the ridges of the top
  six rows of faces. This was done by starting with a 45 degree angle and decreasing the angle by 5 
  degrees for each panal in ascending order. This created the desired twisted appearance
- Created construction planes offset towards the inside of the bottle a small distance from the bottom 
  and the top
- Used the Split Body command to remove the material outside of the two planes, leaving a bottle without
  the previously jagged top and bottom
- Used the Patch command to close the hole in the bottom and used the Stitch command to recreate one body
- Used the Thicken command to create a solid body
  

**Notes:**
- Learned that extending a form while holding the ALT key creates additional faces according to the 
  previous pattern; otherwise, the faces will just stretch
- Learned how to define the number of faces for ease of design and best outcome
- Next step: Model a nozzle gimbal mechanism (Week 4-5 project)
