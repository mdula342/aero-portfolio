# Week 2 - Fusion 360 Basics: Screwdriver Model

**Software:** Autodesk Fusion 360  
**Date:** October 24, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn methods for organizing assemblies, Circular Pattern command

**Design Summary:**
- Created two components: "Handle" and "Shank"
- Activated "Handle", extruded a circle, and cut grooves in the cylinder by using the Circular Pattern 
feature to create a pattern from a semicircular cutting extrusion
- Used the Three Point Arc command to sketch a dip in the handle near the shank and cut
around the handle using the revolve feature
- Extruded a circle into the handle to create space for the shank
- Activated the shank component and extruded the inner circle out beyond the handle to create the 
shank shaft
- Used the Three Point Arc command to model the side profile of the tip and mirrored a symmetric cutting
extrusion to create the full tip shape

**Notes:**
- Learned the value of using the Project feature to optimize Fusion's parametric nature, i.e., allowing 
one to change the value of an extrusion by simply editing the Project feature in the timeline
- Learned how to organize components prior to initiating an assembly design
- Next step: Model the fins and nosecone of model rocket kit (Week 3 project)
