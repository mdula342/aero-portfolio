# Aero-portfolio
Hi, my name is Matthew Dula, and I am an American mechanical engineering student currently in my first year of undergraduate studies in Italy. My passion is aerospace engineering, and this repo documents my learning journey in simulations, electronics, CAD, and rocket builds.
## Current status as of October 8, 2025
- **Math** â€” Multivariable Calculus (completed), Numerical Methods (in progress)  
- **Python** â€” beginner (plotting & simple scripts) ðŸ”§ In progress (started Oct 2025)  
- **OpenRocket** â€” learning (running simulations) ðŸ”§ In progress  
- **CAD (Fusion 360)** â€” beginner (basic solid and surface modelling) 
- **Microcontrollers (Arduino/Pico)** â€” beginner â€” ðŸ•’ Planned
## Short-term goals (8 weeks)
1. Fly a beginner model-rocket kit at a sanctioned launch and publish **Flight Report #1**.  
2. Learn basic Fusion360 workflows (sketch â†’ extrude â†’ assembly) and upload screenshots.
