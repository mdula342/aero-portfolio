# Rocket Builds Oct.13 1-3

**Software:** OpenRocket  
**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Objective:** Observe stability changes with adjustment of fin specifications 

**Design Summary:**
- Rocket length: 55 cm  
- Motor: B6-0 
	**Control Rocket:**
	- Sweep angle: 39.8
	- Root chord: 4
	- Fin cant: 0
	- Stability:1.27 cal/9.1%
	**Rocket 1:** 
	- Sweep angle: 30
	- Stability: 1.29 cal/9.29%
	**Rocket 2:**
	- Root chord: 53
	- Stability: 1.85 cal/7.1%
	**Rocket 3:**
	- Fin cant: 15 
	- Stability: 1.3/9.25%

**Notes:**
- Changed one fin specification for each rocket 1-3 and observed result
- Stability did not increase for any increase in sweep angle beyond 29 and eventually decreased
- Stability also did not increase for any increase in root chord beyond 53 and eventually decreased
- Stability continued to increase slightly for all allowable increases in fin cant
- Next step: study the effect of fin specifications on drag and maximum velocity
