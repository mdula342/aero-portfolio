# Aero Test 1 - Familiarization Flight

**Software:** OpenRocket  
**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Objective:** Learn OpenRocket interface and run a basic simulation.

**Design Summary:**
- Rocket length: 50 cm  
- Motor: A6-4  
- Apogee: 10.4 m  
- Max velocity: 12.7 m/s  
- Stability: 0.65 cal (marginal)

**Notes:**
- Practiced adding basic parts and familiarized myself with their basic functions
- Practiced running and editing flight simulations
- Next step: Adjust fin geometry and test stability changes
